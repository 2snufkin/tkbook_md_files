# Developer's best practices

These principles aim to enhance code quality, reduce complexity, and facilitate collaboration among developers.

## General Best Practices

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Strive for simplicity in design and implementation. Avoid unnecessary complexity that can hinder understanding and maintenance.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Eliminate redundancy in code by abstracting common functionalities into reusable components, promoting maintainability and reducing errors.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Only implement features necessary for current requirements. Avoid speculative development to prevent unnecessary complexity.
- **Boy Scout Rule:** Leave the codebase in a better state than you found it. Consistently improve code quality through small, incremental enhancements.
- **Regularly Remove Dead Code:** Identify and eliminate unused or obsolete code to maintain a clean, efficient, and secure software environment, reducing complexity and aiding future maintenance.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Keep one authoritative source for a particular piece of information to avoid inconsistencies and ensure data integrity.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write unit tests before writing the code to ensure the code meets specified requirements, promoting robustness and aiding in code refactoring.
- **Don't Make Me Think:** Design software and interfaces to be intuitive, requiring minimal cognitive effort from users for enhanced user experience.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Include detailed comments, function descriptions, and relevant information in the source code to facilitate understanding and maintenance, ensuring transparency for developers.

## Writing Methods Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure each method has a single responsibility, promoting modularity and improving code comprehension.
- **Descriptive and Meaningful Names:** Choose names that clearly convey the purpose of the method for better readability and understanding.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Follow a consistent naming convention across the codebase to enhance readability and maintain a unified coding style.
- **Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings:** Refactor code to eliminate magic numbers or strings, using constants or enumerations for better code maintainability.
- **Method Length:** Keep methods short...
