In the project, there is a notable presence of unused or commented code, which refers to large sections of code that have been commented out but remain within the codebase. Although the term "dead code" traditionally refers to code that is no longer executed, we will use the term "unused or commented code" to describe this specific situation in the context of this project. It is important to understand the potential disadvantages of leaving such code in the project and the benefits of addressing it appropriately.

### Disadvantages of Unused or Commented Code:

1. **Reduced Code Readability**: Having significant amounts of unused or commented code within the codebase makes it more challenging to read and understand. It adds unnecessary noise and complexity to the code, potentially confusing developers and making it harder to grasp the true functionality of the active code.

2. **Increased Maintenance Effort**: Maintaining unused or commented code requires additional effort and time from developers. They may need to spend valuable resources navigating through or around the unused code, potentially leading to confusion, wasted time, and an increased risk of introducing errors during modifications or updates.

3. **Codebase Bloating**: Unused or commented code adds unnecessary bulk to the project. This can impact performance, increase compilation times, and unnecessarily occupy storage space. Additionally, it may make it more difficult to manage and maintain the codebase, particularly when trying to locate and modify specific sections of active code.

4. **Risk of Misinterpretation**: Leaving commented code in the project can create confusion and misinterpretation for future developers. They may misunderstand the purpose or intent of the commented code, leading to incorrect assumptions and potentially perpetuating flawed practices. This can hinder...
