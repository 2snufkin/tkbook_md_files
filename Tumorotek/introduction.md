# Introduction

## Project Overview

The TK® software is a tool for managing collections of biological samples. It includes the following features:

- Reception information:
  - Patient and disease
  - Samples and sampling information
  - Information about the transfers 
- Storage and inventory management
- Management of derived products
- Management of sample transfers
- Customizable management of patient/sample/derived product/transfers annotations by collection
- Querying based on multiple criteria
- Quality management of samples
- Generation of reports (graphs and indicators)
- Integration with other systems:
  - Importing patient identities from the Hospital Information System (HIS)
  - Importing from Excel files
  - Importing from Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) such as DIAMIC and APIX
  - Exporting to catalogs (such as Cancéropôle Grand Sud-Ouest, BIOCAP, biobanks, etc.)
  
### Administration of the software:

- Account and authorization management
- Collaboration settings
- Storage structure management
